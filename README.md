# 🚀 Week 1 — RTL Design & Logic Synthesis

🌟 This is **Week 1** of the **VSD RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program** —

I explored **Verilog RTL design**, learned about **simulation (Icarus + GTKWave)**,

understood **logic synthesis using Yosys**,

and studied the importance of **cell libraries, timing (.lib), faster vs slower cells**,

and advanced synthesis topics like **optimizations, GLS, and coding constructs (if/case, for/generate)**.

## 📒 Key Learnings

### 📌 Day 1 — Verilog RTL Design & Simulation

- **RTL Design** → Circuits at register & logic level (synthesizable Verilog).
- **Icarus Verilog** → For compiling + simulating designs.
- **GTKWave** → To visualize & debug waveform outputs.

### 📌 Day 2 — Logic Synthesis & Timing Libraries

- **Yosys** → Converts RTL → Gate-level netlist.
- **.lib Files** → Contain timing, power, and area info of standard cells.
- **Hierarchical vs Flat Synthesis**:
    - Hierarchical → preserves design hierarchy.
    - Flat → merges logic for aggressive optimization.

### 📌 Day 3 — Optimizations in Synthesis

- **Slow Cells** → Prevent hold violations (ensure stability).
- **Fast Cells** → Reduce setup delay, but increase power & area.
- **Optimization Balance** → Synthesizer chooses cells for optimum PPA.
- **Combinational Optimization** → Removes redundant gates.
- **Sequential Optimization** → Removes unused flops/outputs.

### 📌 Day 4 — GLS & Synthesis-Simulation Mismatch

- **GLS (Gate-Level Simulation)** → Ensures netlist correctness vs RTL.
- **Synthesis-Simulation Mismatch** → Can arise from coding styles.
- **Blocking vs Non-blocking** → Critical in sequential logic.
- Labs → Debugging mismatches with testbenches.

### 📌 Day 5 — Advanced Coding Constructs & Optimizations

- **If/Case Constructs** → Handling complete, incomplete, overlapping cases.
- **Labs** → Show how missing cases → latch inference or mismatch.
- **For Loop** → Used in *always* block (evaluations).
- **For-Generate** → Replicates hardware (outside always).
- Built **Ripple Carry Adder (RCA)** elegantly using **for-generate**.
